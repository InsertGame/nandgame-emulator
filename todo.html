		<pre style="padding: 5px;" id="sysinfo">
Some way of using sound, maybe memory mapped
	4 different sound "channels"
	each 16 bit number represents a pitch
	3 squares and a noise channel maybe
			
Keyboard and mouse input, one byte memory mapped, 16 buttons,
	up, down, left, right, z (or c), x, enter (or return), shift,
	w, a, s, d, left click (or q), right click (or e), tilda (~), space
			
2 signed 16 bit values signifying mouse distance x and distance y
	values increase or decrease based on mouse movement, not reset automatically
	as soon as these values are set, we can assume the mouse is being used, and we can lock it on the display window
			
TEST keyword, testing condition of values or doing repetative actions, would mainly be used in macros
	you can use <code>\</code> to make instructions span multiple lines
	EX: <code>TEST if {arg1} equal A insert A = {arg2}</code>
	EX: <code>TEST repeat 5 insert A = {index}\</code>
	    <code>*A = A</code>

Extended DEFINE keyword, for changing the defined constant
	instead of just doing <code>DEFINE constname &lt;value></code>, you can substitute the value for a symbol
	<code>=</code> allows you to set the value to a different one
	<code>+</code> allows you to increase the value by something
	<code>-</code> allows you to decrease the value by something
	this allows you to have compile-time updating constants
	new optional syntax of <code>DEFINE constname &lt;op> &lt;value></code>

Binary file editor
	maybe embed a version of qbrt into the site?
	just for storing bytes
		
Use <code>@"filename"</code> to include other files
	would be the names to other locally stored files
	when including a binary file, you can use <code>@"filename", macroname</code> to generate a macro titled <code>macroname</code> 
	macro would have one parameter, which loads the binary file into the location in memory specified

Make engine compiled instead of interpreted
	currently the engine is interpreted, and can run pretty fast as is
	however its currently an interpreted system on top of another interpreted language: javascript
	if i can generate javascript code from the assembly it could boost performance a bit
	engine already uses "compiled" code thats just interpreted, generates an array of functions

Uploading files
	make uploading your project's file possible, send it to a server others can browse
	uploads included files as well, but only the main one shows up on the list
	can download online projects and view them, downloads related files as well (and replaces name conflicts as well)

ROM Banks
	your code can only be 65536 bytes big
	rom banks allow you to swap out different "banks" or files
	would use the 3 unused bits in the instruction to add 8,
	having 8 banks allows for 524288 bytes total
	could be access by simply adding a number after the jump condition
	EX: <code>D = D - *A; JNE 3</code> jumps to bank 4
